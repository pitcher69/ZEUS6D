# ZEUS6D: Zero-shot Estimation of Unseen Shapes for 6DoF Pose Recovery  **ZEUS6D** is a training-free deep learning pipeline for estimating the **6D pose** of known objects from a single RGB image using their CAD models. The framework is designed to work without object-specific training or fine-tuning, enabling fast and scalable deployment in real-world scenarios.  ## üîç What is 6D Pose Estimation?  **6D pose estimation** refers to determining the full 3D position and orientation of an object with respect to the camera. Specifically, it estimates: - **3 degrees of freedom (DoF)** for rotation (roll, pitch, yaw) - **3 DoF** for translation (x, y, z coordinates)  Together, these form a transformation:  $$ \begin{bmatrix} R & t \\ 0 & 1 \end{bmatrix} $$  More precisely, this is a $4 \times 4$ homogeneous transformation matrix of the form:  $$ \begin{bmatrix} r_{11} & r_{12} & r_{13} & t_x \\ r_{21} & r_{22} & r_{23} & t_y \\ r_{31} & r_{32} & r_{33} & t_z \\ 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 \end{bmatrix} $$  Where: - $R$ is a $3 \times 3$ rotation matrix - $t = (t_x, t_y, t_z)$ is the 3D translation vector  ### üõ† Why It Matters  Accurate 6D pose estimation is critical for: - Robotic manipulation and grasping - Augmented and virtual reality - Scene understanding and 3D reconstruction - Industrial automation and inspection  Unlike conventional methods that rely on object-specific training data, **ZEUS6D** enables **zero-shot inference** for novel objects using only their CAD models ‚Äî no retraining required.  ## üìΩÔ∏è Examples  AR APPLICATIONS  ![AR](examples/317560123-80e96855-a73c-4bee-bcef-7cba92df55ca.gif)  OUR DEMO  ![Demo](examples/my_comparison_animation.gif)
